Snake demo (simple Swing) — placed in your .Test folder for OOP practice.

Location:
  c:\VSCode_Projects\Java\.Test\SnakeGame\src\snake

How to compile & run (PowerShell):

# from the src folder
cd 'C:\VSCode_Projects\Java\.Test\SnakeGame\src'
javac snake\*.java
java -cp . snake.Main

Notes:
- Use arrow keys to move the snake.
- Press R to restart after game over.
- This is intentionally tiny and visible; we'll iterate on classes separately.
