# Beginners-Code-ARC

This repository is a personal code archive containing incomplete, experimental,
and finished code written during my time at Texas Tech University starting in 2022.

It includes lecture examples, practice problems, and small projects across
multiple programming languages. The goal is organization, reflection, and
showing progression—not perfection.
